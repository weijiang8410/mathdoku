# Why does the application log information? #

In version 1.96 of MathDoku, the application saves anonymous data about the way you play MathDoku. The developers are interested in which functions of MathDoku are actually used. This information will be used to decide upon features to build in upcoming versions.

## What information is collected? ##

The application saves information about the following:
  * The Android version
  * The size of your screen
  * The number of games stored
  * Which options you use

We guarantee that no personal data is collected.

You can easily view the data collected before actually sending it via email.

# Sharing data #

## What will happen if I don't want to share my data? ##

Of course we encourage you to share your usage data with us. But it has no effect if you choose not to. You can still continue to play the game as normal.

## Why is data sent by email? ##

MathDoku requires minimal permissions when installed. Therefore the app is not able to send any data without your consent. For easy of use it prepares an email message for you containing an attachment with the usage data collected. This email will not be sent until you click the send button.

If you send us your log file, we will not use your email address in any way, except to reply to you if you send additional comments / questions in the email message.


# Survey #
(For future use)
## Why am I asked to fill in an survey? ##

We only collect some basic information about the way you use the current version of the app. We have some big plans for the future versions of MathDoku. We want to involve our users in future development.

## Can I share my data but skip the survey? ##

Yes, of course. In case you do not fill in your email address we will not send our survey to you. We will not use the email address you have used to sent us your data.

## When will I receive the survey? ##

At this moment we don't know when the survey will be sent.
